Mass Immunization System

This project will create a mass immunization system (the "MIS").  MIS will use a FHIR server to store the immunization records, encounters and patients.  It is likely that this project will be launched as a SIIM 2020 Hack-A-Thon project.  The goal is to eventually deliver a solution to a health care provider.  It is likely that the solution will reside completely in the cloud.
